description: how the hub works
---

The hub is the part for the response and bearing seat. This part can be printed any way that the designer chooses as long as the outer radius dimension is kept. The inner radius is shown as a minimum value here so you can design with an axle system larger than the through hole.

### Gap Control

The hub shown below only shows the minimum thickness of the part. The desiner is free to make this as thick as they like to increase the yo-yo's gap. openThrow comes with several out of the box.

> **Note:** The current hub depths are randomly adding width. There will be updated versions that are designed to be used with specific axle widths to reduce confusion.
